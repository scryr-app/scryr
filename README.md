# ðŸ”® Scryr

Actionable Architecture.

## Codename

There are 3 different layers to a scryr diagram

1. _Blueprint_ - The Scryr cue file This gets checked in and is plain text
   1. Can be embedded in markdown
   2. Can create a markdown readme
   3. useful for MCP
2. _Facade_ This enhances the blue print with additional display things, like
   technology framework icons. 
   It is ultimately an abstraction layer that can plug into blueprints. 
   The default facade is for SaaS Business
   Components, but there are others... down below
3. _Neighborhood_ - This is information about the diagram as a metaphor for a
   neighborhood of buildings and roads that encompass information like layout,
   color theme, custom positions, etc.
   This is the actual implementation of the diagram. All specific user changes to customize the diagram occur here.

## Future Facades

The Facade can also be switched out with:

- SaaS Infrastructure (SsiAws) - AWS deployment components
- CICD - dynamic design that shows as your job gets build
- Data Orchestrator - replacement for Dagster
- SaaS Infrastructure (SSiGcP) - GCP deployment components
- Code Hiearchy (Sch) - Showing how code relates to business processes and
  more of a Doxygen view
